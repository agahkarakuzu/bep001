A naming convention that can logically group parametrically linked anatomy imaging datasets can be achieved by combining following key/value pairs:

1. Suffix (a.k.a modality_label)               (REQUIRED)
2. [\_indexable\_metadata-<index>]             (RECOMMENDED)
3. [\_acq-<label>]                             (RECOMMENDED)
4. [\_part-<mag/phase>]                        (OPTIONAL)


### Suffix

Quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques can be referred by i) sequence names, ii) outputs they generate or iii) special acronyms. As a result, a list of qMRI methods (values) cannot be semantically linked to a single key. To free this field from a key tag, names of the qMRI methods are stored in the `suffix` (a.k.a `<modality_label>`). If several scans of the same modality are intended to create a quantitative map, they MUST be labeled by `suffix`.

| Suffix  | Method Name                              | Output Name                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| VFA     | Variable Flip Angle                      | T1Map                          |
| IRT1    | Inversion Recovery                       | T1Map                          |
| MP2RAGE | Magnetization Prepared 2 Gradient Echoes | T1Map, UNIT1                   |
| MESET2  | Multi-Echo Spin Echo                     | MWF, T2Map                     |
| MTR     | Magnetization Transfer Ratio             | MTRmap                         |
| MTS     | Magnetization Transfer Saturation        | MTsat, T1map                   |
| MPM     | Multi-Parameter Mapping (hMRI)           | R1map, R2starmap, MTsat, PDmap |
| SESL    | Spin Echo-Spin Lock                      | T1Rmap                         |

### `indexable_metadata-<index>` key-value pair

If the grouping logic of several scans of the same modality is (entirely or partially) bound up with a metadata field (which varies between scans), `indexable_metadata-<index>` SHOULD be included in the file name. This is applicable if the varying entries of the same metadata field are enumerable. Unlike other key-value pairs, key tag of the `indexable_metadata-<index>` is mutable depending on the metadata field that varies between several scans of the same modality intended to create quantitative map(s):

| Key tag | Value list | Associated metadata |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| fa      | 1,2,... N  | FlipAngle           |
| inv     | 1,2,... N  | InversionTime       |
| echo    | 1,2,... N  | EchoTime            |
| tsl     | 1,2,... N  | SpinLockTime        |

### `acq-<label>` key-value pair

If the grouping logic of several scans of the same modality is (entirely or partially) bound up with a metadata field (which varies between scans), `acq-<label>` SHOULD be included in the file name. This is applicable if the varying entries of the same metadata field are categorical. Note that value of the `acq-<label>` is free form. However, to enable a unified naming convention while combining several scans of the same modality intended to create quantitative map(s), following labels SHOULD be included in the filename where applicable:

| Method Name | Labels           | Respective metadata fields   |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| MTR         | MTon, MToff      | MTC (Sequence variant attr.) |
| MTS         | MTon, MToff, T1w | MTC (Sequence variant attr.) |
| MPM         | MTon, MToff, T1w | MTC (Sequence variant attr.) |
