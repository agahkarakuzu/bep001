Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 1250 `Receive Coil Name`, although not all vendors populate that DICOM Tag, in which case this field can be derived from an appropriate private DICOM field                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ReceiveCoilActiveElements     | RECOMMENDED. Information describing the active/selected elements of the receiver coil. This doesn’t correspond to a tag in the DICOM ontology. The vendor-defined terminology for active coil elements can go in this field. As an example, for Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually, but rather in pre-defined selectable "groups" of individual channels, and the list of the "groups" of elements that are active/selected in any given scan populates the `Coil String` entry in Siemen’s private DICOM fields (e.g., `HEA;HEP` for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil when both the anterior and posterior groups are activated). This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate for a given vendor and coil to define the "active" coil elements. Since individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected, it is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM for each individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking that a given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected |
| GradientSetType               | RECOMMENDED. It should be possible to infer the gradient coil from the scanner model. If not, e.g. because of a custom upgrade or use of a gradient insert set, then the specifications of the actual gradient coil should be reported independently                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| MRTransmitCoilSequence        | RECOMMENDED. This is a relevant field if a non-standard transmit coil is used. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 9049 `MR Transmit Coil Sequence`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| MatrixCoilMode                | RECOMMENDED. (If used) A method for reducing the number of independent channels by combining in analog the signals from multiple coil elements. There are typically different default modes when using un-accelerated or accelerated (e.g. GRAPPA, SENSE) imaging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CoilCombinationMethod         | RECOMMENDED. Almost all fMRI studies using phased-array coils use root-sum-of-squares (rSOS) combination, but other methods exist. The image reconstruction is changed by the coil combination method (as for the matrix coil mode above), so anything non-standard should be reported                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| ParallelReductionFactorInPlane | RECOMMENDED. The parallel imaging (e.g, GRAPPA) factor. Use the denominator of the fraction of k-space encoded for each slice. For example, 2 means half of k-space is encoded. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 9069 `Parallel Reduction Factor In-plane`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| PartialFourier                 | RECOMMENDED. The fraction of partial Fourier information collected. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 9081 `Partial Fourier`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| PartialFourierDirection        | RECOMMENDED. The direction where only partial Fourier information was collected. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 9036 `Partial Fourier Direction`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| PhaseEncodingDirection         | RECOMMENDED. Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-`. The letters `i`, `j`, `k` correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIFTI file. The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum index unless `-` sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from the highest index instead of zero). `PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the direction along which phase is was modulated which may result in visible distortions. Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term `InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values. This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present or when using multiple runs with different phase encoding directions (which can be later used for field inhomogeneity correction). |
| EffectiveEchoSpacing           | RECOMMENDED. The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds, between lines in the phase-encoding direction, defined based on the size of the reconstructed image in the phase direction. It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as "dwell time" (see DwellTime parameter below for actual dwell time). It is required for unwarping distortions using field maps. Note that beyond just in-plane acceleration, a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding need to be accounted for properly, including partial fourier, phase oversampling, phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.<sup>2</sup> This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present.                                                                                                                    |
| TotalReadoutTime               | RECOMMENDED. This is actually the "effective" total readout time , defined as the readout duration, specified in seconds, that would have generated data with the given level of distortion. It is NOT the actual, physical duration of the readout train. If `EffectiveEchoSpacing` has been properly computed, it is just `EffectiveEchoSpacing * (ReconMatrixPE - 1)`.<sup>3</sup> . This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding "field/distortion" maps acquired with opposing phase encoding directions are present (see 8.9.4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<sup>2</sup>Conveniently, for Siemens’ data, this value is easily obtained as
1/\[`BWPPPE` \* `ReconMatrixPE`\], where BWPPPE is the
"`BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode` in DICOM tag (0019,1028) and ReconMatrixPE is
the size of the actual reconstructed data in the phase direction (which is NOT
reflected in a single DICOM tag for all possible aforementioned scan
manipulations). See [here](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/kb-articles/kb-0003) and
[here](https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm_qa/tree/master/In/TotalReadoutTime)

<sup>3</sup>We use the "FSL definition", i.e, the time between the center of the
first "effective" echo and the center of the last "effective" echo.

Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 0081 `Echo Time` (please note that the DICOM term is in milliseconds not seconds).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| InversionTime          | RECOMMENDED. The inversion time (TI) for the acquisition, specified in seconds. Inversion time is the time after the middle of inverting RF pulse to middle of excitation pulse to detect the amount of longitudinal magnetization. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018, 0082 `Inversion Time` (please note that the DICOM term is in milliseconds not seconds).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SliceTiming            | RECOMMENDED. The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the acquisition. Slice timing is not slice order -- rather, it is a list of times (in JSON format) containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is important to check if the (optional) `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in `SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis (i.e., the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of slice 0). This parameter is REQUIRED for sparse sequences that do not have the `DelayTime` field set. In addition without this parameter slice time correction will not be possible. |
| SliceEncodingDirection | RECOMMENDED. Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-` (the axis of the NIfTI data along which slices were acquired, and the direction in which SliceTiming is defined with respect to). `i`, `j`, `k` identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIfTI file. A `-` sign indicates that the contents of SliceTiming are defined in reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds to the slice with the largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice index zero. When present ,the axis defined by SliceEncodingDirection needs to be consistent with the ‘slice_dim’ field in the NIfTI header. When absent, the entries in SliceTiming must be in the order of increasing slice index as defined by the NIfTI header.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| DwellTime              | RECOMMENDED. Actual dwell time (in seconds) of the receiver per point in the readout direction, including any oversampling. For Siemens, this corresponds to DICOM field (0019,1018) (in ns). This value is necessary for the (optional) readout distortion correction of anatomicals in the HCP Pipelines. It also usefully provides a handle on the readout bandwidth, which isn’t captured in the other metadata tags. Not to be confused with `EffectiveEchoSpacing`, and the frequent mislabeling of echo spacing (which is spacing in the phase encoding direction) as "dwell time" (which is spacing in the readout direction).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Anatomy imaging data

Template:

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    anat/
        sub-<participant_label>_<suffix>.json
        sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_<indexable_metadata>-<index>][_acq-<label>][_part-<mag/phase>][_ce-<label>][_rec-<label>][_run-<index>]_<suffix>.nii[.gz]
        sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_<indexable_metadata>-<index>][_acq-<label>][_part-<mag/phase>][_ce-<label>][_rec-<label>][_run-<index>]_<suffix>.json
```
Anatomical (structural) data for a participant may refer to a simple standalone
data (e.g. a 3D high resolution T1 weighted image), or a group of parametrically 
linked images acquired on the purpose of calculating quantitative maps
(e.g. three 3D volumes provided as an input to the multiparametric mapping 
protocol) and/or the quantitative parameter maps themselves (e.g. T1map etc.). 

All anatomy imaging data filenames can include the key/value pairs of
`run-<index>`, `ce-<label>` or `rec-<label>`. 

If the same acquisition for a given `_suffix` is repeated without any parameter 
changes, they must be indexed with the key/value pair of `run-<index>`:
`_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3` etc. (only integers are allowed as run numbers).
When there is only one scan of a given type, the run key MAY be omitted.

The OPTIONAL `ce-<label>` key/value can be used to distinguish
sequences using different contrast enhanced images. The label is the name of the
contrast agent. The key `ContrastBolusIngredient` MAY be also be added in the
JSON file, with the same label.

The OPTIONAL `rec-<label>` key/value can be used to distinguish
different reconstruction algorithms (for example ones using motion correction).

If the structural images included in the dataset were defaced (to protect
identity of participants) one CAN provide the binary mask that was used to
remove facial features in the form of `_defacemask` files. In such cases the
OPTIONAL `mod-<label>` key/value pair corresponds to the suffix for example: T1w,
referenced by a defacemask image:

```
sub-01_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz
sub-01_mod-T1w_defacemask.json 
```

Some meta information about the acquisition MAY be provided in an additional
JSON file. See Common MR metadata fields for a list of terms and their
definitions. There are also some OPTIONAL JSON fields specific to anatomical
scans:

| Field name              | Definition                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ContrastBolusIngredient | OPTIONAL. Active ingredient of agent. Values MUST be one of: IODINE, GADOLINIUM, CARBON DIOXIDE, BARIUM, XENON Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018,1048. |


#### Suffix

If a structural data is not intended for creating a quantitative map, the use of
`_suffix` is REQUIRED (along with the common key/value pairs if applicable) to 
provide a self explanatory filename. For example: 

```Text
sub-01_run-1_T1w.nii.gz
sub-01_run-1_T1w.json
sub-01_run-2_T1w.nii.gz
sub-01_run-2_T1w.json
```

The `run-<index>` in the example above denotes the index of the acquisition 
repeated with the identical parameters (e.g. to achieve a higher SNR). Please 
note that changing parameters between multiple acquisitions of the same sequence
creates a different use case: parametrically linked anatomical images.

If a structural data is a member of parametrically linked anatomical images,
the use of `_suffix` alone cannot distinguish individual acquisitions from each 
other, failing to identify their roles as inputs to the calculation of 
quantitative maps. Although, such images are REQUIRED to be grouped by a proper
`_suffix` (please see the list of available suffixes), they are also RECOMMENDED
to include at least one of the `acq-<label>`, `part-<label>` and 
`<indexable_metadata>-<index>` key/value pairs (please visit corresponding 
sections for details).  

Please note that not only parametrically linked anatomical images, but also 
outputs (quantitative maps) created by processing these files fall into the 
category of anatomy imaging data. In addition, in some cases, quantitative maps 
can be obtained right off the scanner without the need of storing any 
parametrically linked anatomical images and further processing. For both cases,
a proper `_suffix` is REQUIRED for describing quantitative maps. Please see the
list of available suffixes.

#### `<indexable_metadata>-<index>` key-value pair

If the grouping logic of a set of parametrically linked anatomical images is 
(entirely or partially) bound up with a metadata field that varies from image to
image, `<indexable_metadata>-<index>` SHOULD be included in the file name. This
is applicable if the varying entries of the same metadata field are enumerable.

Unlike other key/value pairs, key tag of the `<indexable_metadata>-<index>` is 
mutable depending on the metadata field that varies between several scans of the
same modality and can appear more than once in the filename with different keys.

Please note that the order of the `index` and the value of the associated 
metadata field do NOT have to be coherent (i.e. `fa-1`,`fa-2` and `fa-3` can
correspond to the `FlipAngle` of `35`, `10` and `25` degrees).


| Allowed key tags | Value list | Associated metadata field |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| fa      | 1,2,... N  | FlipAngle           |
| inv     | 1,2,... N  | InversionTime       |
| echo    | 1,2,... N  | EchoTime            |
| tsl     | 1,2,... N  | SpinLockTime        |

#### `acq-<label>` key-value pair

If the grouping logic of a set of parametrically linked anatomical images is
(entirely or partially) bound up with a metadata field that varies from image to
image, `acq-<label>` SHOULD be included in the file name. This is applicable if
the varying entries of the metadata field are categorical. 

Note that value of the `acq-<label>` is free form. However, to enable a unified
naming convention while combining several scans of the same modality intended to
create quantitative maps, following labels SHOULD be included in the filename 
where applicable:

| Respective suffix | Labels           | Related metadata fields   |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| MTR         | `MTon`, `MToff`      | MTState |
| MTS         | `MTon`, `MToff`, `T1w` | MTstate, FlipAngle |
| MPM         | `MTon`, `MToff`, `T1w`| MTstate, FlipAngle |

#### `part-<label>` key/value pair

Some parametrically linked anatomical images involve both magnitude and phase  
reconstructed images in the calculation of a parameter map. In that case, the 
filename MUST make use of this key/value pair to distinguish between them. 
The `part-<mag/phase>` key/value pair is associated with the DICOM tag 0008,0008
`Image Type`. For example, see `MP2RAGE` suffix. 

### Task (including resting state) imaging data

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    func/
        sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>]_task-<task_label>[_acq-<label>][_rec-<label>][_run-<index>][_echo-<index>]_bold.nii[.gz]
        sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>]_task-<task_label>[_acq-<label>][_rec-<label>][_run-<index>][_echo-<index>]_sbref.nii[.gz]
```

Imaging data acquired during BOLD imaging. This includes but is not limited to
task based fMRI as well as resting state fMRI (i.e. rest is treated as another
task). For task based fMRI a corresponding task events file (see below) MUST be
provided (please note that this file is not necessary for resting state scans).
For multiband acquisitions, one MAY also save the single-band reference image as
type `sbref` (e.g. `sub-control01_task-nback_sbref.nii.gz`).

Each task has a unique label MUST only include of letters and/or numbers (other
characters including spaces and underscores are not allowed). Those labels MUST
be consistent across subjects and sessions.

If more than one run of the same task has been acquired a key/value pair:
`_run-1`, `_run-2`, `_run-3` etc. MUST be used. If only one run was acquired the
`run-<index>` can be omitted. In the context of functional imaging a run is
defined as the same task, but in some cases it can mean different set of stimuli
(for example randomized order) and participant responses.

The OPTIONAL `acq-<label>` key/value pair corresponds to a custom label one may
use to distinguish different set of parameters used for acquiring the same task.
For example this should be used when a study includes two resting state images -
one single band and one multiband. In such case two files could have the
following names: `sub-01_task-rest_acq-singleband_bold.nii.gz` and
`sub-01_task-rest_acq-multiband_bold.nii.gz`, however the user is MAY choose any
other label than `singleband` and `multiband` as long as they are consistent
across subjects and sessions and consist only of the legal label characters.

Similarly the optional `rec-<label>` key/value can be used to distinguish
different reconstruction algorithms (for example ones using motion correction).

Multi echo data MUST  be split into one file per echo. Each file shares the same
name with the exception of the `_echo-<index>` key/value. For example:

```Text
sub-01/
   func/
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-1_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-1_bold.json
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-2_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-2_bold.json
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-3_bold.nii.gz
      sub-01_task-cuedSGT_run-1_echo-3_bold.json
```

Please note that the `<index>` denotes the number/index (in a form of an
integer) of the echo not the echo time value which needs to be stored in the
field EchoTime of the separate JSON file.

Some meta information about the acquisition MUST be provided in an additional
JSON file.

#### Required fields

| Field name     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RepetitionTime | REQUIRED. The time in seconds between the beginning of an acquisition of one volume and the beginning of acquisition of the volume following it (TR). Please note that this definition includes time between scans (when no data has been acquired) in case of sparse acquisition schemes. This value needs to be consistent with the `pixdim[4]` field (after accounting for units stored in `xyzt_units` field) in the NIfTI header. This field is mutually exclusive with `VolumeTiming` and is derived from DICOM Tag 0018, 0080 and converted to seconds. |
| VolumeTiming   | REQUIRED. The time at which each volume was acquired during the acquisition. It is described using a list of times (in JSON format) referring to the onset of each volume in the BOLD series. The list must have the same length as the BOLD series, and the values must be non-negative and monotonically increasing. This field is mutually exclusive with RepetitionTime and `DelayTime`. If defined, this requires acquisition time (TA) be defined via either SliceTiming or AcquisitionDuration be defined.                                              |
| TaskName       | REQUIRED. Name of the task. No two tasks should have the same name. Task label (`task-`) included in the file name is derived from this field by removing all non alphanumeric (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`) characters. For example task name `faces n-back` will corresponds to task label `facesnback`. An optional but RECOMMENDED convention is to name resting state task using labels beginning with `rest`.                                                                                                                                                          |

For the fields described above and in the following section, the term "Volume"
refers to a reconstruction of the object being imaged (e.g., brain or part of a
brain). In case of multiple channels in a coil, the term "Volume" refers to a
combined image rather than an image from each coil.

| Field name                        | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner | RECOMMENDED. Number of volumes ("dummy scans") discarded by the scanner (as opposed to those discarded by the user post hoc) before saving the imaging file. For example, a sequence that automatically discards the first 4 volumes before saving would have this field as 4. A sequence that doesn't discard dummy scans would have this set to 0. Please note that the onsets recorded in the \_event.tsv file should always refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding imaging file - independent of the value of `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner` field. |
| NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser    | RECOMMENDED. Number of volumes ("dummy scans") discarded by the user before including the file in the dataset. If possible, including all of the volumes is strongly recommended. Please note that the onsets recorded in the \_event.tsv file should always refer to the beginning of the acquisition of the first volume in the corresponding imaging file - independent of the value of `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser` field.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| DelayTime                         | RECOMMENDED. User specified time (in seconds) to delay the acquisition of data for the following volume. If the field is not present it is assumed to be set to zero. Corresponds to Siemens CSA header field `lDelayTimeInTR`. This field is REQUIRED for sparse sequences using the RepetitionTime field that do not have the SliceTiming field set to allowed for accurate calculation of "acquisition time". This field is mutually exclusive with `VolumeTiming`.                                                                                                                                   |
| AcquisitionDuration               | RECOMMENDED. Duration (in seconds) of volume acquisition. Corresponds to DICOM Tag 0018,9073 `Acquisition Duration`. This field is REQUIRED for sequences that are described with the `VolumeTiming` field and that not have the `SliceTiming` field set to allowed for accurate calculation of "acquisition time". This field is mutually exclusive with `RepetitionTime`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| DelayAfterTrigger                 | RECOMMENDED. Duration (in seconds) from trigger delivery to scan onset. This delay is commonly caused by adjustments and loading times. This specification is entirely independent of `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByScanner` or `NumberOfVolumesDiscardedByUser`, as the delay precedes the acquisition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

##### fMRI task information

| Field name      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instructions    | RECOMMENDED. Text of the instructions given to participants before the scan. This is especially important in context of resting state fMRI and distinguishing between eyes open and eyes closed paradigms. |
| TaskDescription | RECOMMENDED. Longer description of the task.                                                                                                                                                               |
| CogAtlasID      | RECOMMENDED. URL of the corresponding [Cognitive Atlas](http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/) Task term.                                                                                                         |
| CogPOID         | RECOMMENDED. URL of the corresponding [CogPO](http://www.cogpo.org/) term.                                                                                                                                 |

See [8.3.1. Common MR metadata fields](#heading=h.5u721tt1h9pe) for a list of
additional terms and their definitions.

Example:

```Text
sub-control01/
    func/
        sub-control01_task-nback_bold.json
```

```JSON
{
   "TaskName": "N Back",
   "RepetitionTime": 0.8,
   "EchoTime": 0.03,
   "FlipAngle": 78,
   "SliceTiming": [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6],
   "MultibandAccelerationFactor": 4,
   "ParallelReductionFactorInPlane": 2,
   "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j",
   "InstitutionName": "Stanford University",
   "InstitutionAddress": "450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305-2004, USA",
   "DeviceSerialNumber": "11035"
}
```

If this information is the same for all participants, sessions and runs it can
be provided in `task-<task_label>_bold.json` (in the root directory of the
dataset). However, if the information differs between subjects/runs it can be
specified in the
`sub-<participant_label>/func/sub-<participant_label>_task-<task_label>[_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_bold.json` file.
If both files are specified fields from the file corresponding to a particular
participant, task and run takes precedence.

### Diffusion imaging data

Template:

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    dwi/
       sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.nii[.gz]
       sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.bval
       sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.bvec
       sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_dwi.json
       sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_sbref.nii[.gz]
       sub-<participant_label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<index>]_sbref.json
```

Diffusion-weighted imaging data acquired for that participant. The optional
`acq-<label>` key/value pair corresponds to a custom label the user may use to
distinguish different set of parameters. For example this should be used when a
study includes two diffusion images - one single band and one multiband. In such
case two files could have the following names:
`sub-01_acq-singleband_dwi.nii.gz` and `sub-01_acq-multiband_dwi.nii.gz`,
however the user is free to choose any other label than `singleband` and
`multiband` as long as they are consistent across subjects and sessions. For
multiband acquisitions, one can also save the single-band reference image as
type `sbref` (e.g. `dwi/sub-control01_sbref.nii[.gz]`) The bvec and bval files
are in the FSL format<sup>4</sup>: The bvec files contain 3 rows with n
space-delimited floating-point numbers (corresponding to the n volumes in the
relevant NIfTI file). The first row contains the x elements, the second row
contains the y elements and third row contains the z elements of a unit vector
in the direction of the applied diffusion gradient, where the i-th elements in
each row correspond together to the i-th volume with `[0,0,0]` for
non-diffusion-weighted volumes. Inherent to the FSL format for bvec
specification is the fact that the coordinate system of the bvecs is with
respect to the participant (i.e., defined by the axes of the corresponding
dwi.nii file) and not the magnet’s coordinate system, which means that any
rotations applied to dwi.nii also need to be applied to the corresponding bvec
file.

<sup>4</sup>[http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl4.0/fdt/fdt_dtifit.html](hhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl4.0/fdt/fdt_dtifit.html)

bvec example:

```Text
0 0 0.021828 -0.015425 -0.70918 -0.2465
0 0 0.80242 0.22098 -0.00063106 0.1043
0 0 -0.59636 0.97516 -0.70503 -0.96351
```

The bval file contains the b-values (in s/mm<sup>2</sup>) corresponding to the
volumes in the relevant NIfTI file), with 0 designating non-diffusion-weighted
volumes, space-delimited.

bval example:

```Text
0 0 2000 2000 1000 1000
```

`.bval` and `.bvec` files can be saved on any level of the directory structure
and thus define those values for all sessions and/or subjects in one place (see
Inheritance principle).

See Common MR metadata fields for a list of additional terms that can be
included in the corresponding JSON file.

JSON example:

```JSON
{
  "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-",
  "TotalReadoutTime": 0.095
}
```

### Fieldmap data

Data acquired to correct for B0 inhomogeneities can come in different forms. The
current version of this standard considers four different scenarios. Please note
that in all cases fieldmap data can be linked to a specific scan(s) it was
acquired for by filling the IntendedFor field in the corresponding JSON file.
For example:

```JSON
{
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

The IntendedFor field may contain one or more filenames with paths relative to
the subject subfolder. The path needs to use forward slashes instead of backward
slashes. Here’s an example with multiple target scans:

```JSON
{
   "IntendedFor": ["ses-pre/func/sub-01_task-motor_run-1_bold.nii.gz",
                   "ses-post/func/sub-01_task-motor_run-1_bold.nii.gz"]
}
```

The IntendedFor field is optional and in case the fieldmaps do not correspond to
any particular scans it does not have to be filled.

Multiple fieldmaps can be stored. In such case the `_run-1`, `_run-2` should be
used. The optional `acq-<label>` key/value pair corresponds to a custom label
the user may use to distinguish different set of parameters.

#### Phase difference image and at least one magnitude image

Template:

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_phasediff.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_phasediff.json
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_magnitude1.nii[.gz]
```

(optional)

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_magnitude2.nii[.gz]
```

This is a common output for build in fieldmap sequence on Siemens scanners. In
this particular case the sidecar JSON file has to define the Echo Times of the
two phase images used to create the difference image. `EchoTime1` corresponds to
the shorter echo time and `EchoTime2` to the longer echo time. Similarly
`_magnitude1` image corresponds to the shorter echo time and the OPTIONAL
`_magnitude2` image to the longer echo time. For example:

```JSON
{
   "EchoTime1": 0.00600,
   "EchoTime2": 0.00746,
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

#### Two phase images and two magnitude images

Template:

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_phase1.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_phase1.json
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_phase2.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_phase2.json
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_magnitude1.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_magnitude2.nii[.gz]
```

Similar to the case above, but instead of a precomputed phase difference map two
separate phase images are presented. The two sidecar JSON file need to specify
corresponding `EchoTime` values. For example:

```JSON
{
   "EchoTime": 0.00746,
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

#### A real fieldmap image

Template:

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    fmap/
       sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_magnitude.nii[.gz]
       sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_fieldmap.nii[.gz]
       sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>][_run-<run_index>]_fieldmap.json
```

In some cases (for example GE) the scanner software will output a precomputed
fieldmap denoting the B0 inhomogeneities along with a magnitude image used for
coregistration. In this case the sidecar JSON file needs to include the units of
the fieldmap. The possible options are: `Hz`, `rad/s`, or `Tesla`. For example:

```JSON
{
   "Units": "rad/s",
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

#### Case 4: Multiple phase encoded directions ("pepolar")

Template:

```Text
sub-<participant_label>/[ses-<session_label>/]
    fmap/
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>]_dir-<dir_label>[_run-<run_index>]_epi.nii[.gz]
        sub-<label>[_ses-<session_label>][_acq-<label>]_dir-<dir_label>[_run-<run_index>]_epi.json
```

The phase-encoding polarity (PEpolar) technique combines two or more Spin Echo
EPI scans with different phase encoding directions to estimate the underlying
inhomogeneity/deformation map. Examples of tools using this kind of images are
FSL TOPUP, AFNI 3dqwarp and SPM. In such a case, the phase encoding direction is
specified in the corresponding JSON file as one of: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`,
`k-`. For these differentially phase encoded sequences, one also needs to
specify the Total Readout Time defined as the time (in seconds) from the center
of the first echo to the center of the last echo (aka "FSL definition" - see
[here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup/Faq#How_do_I_know_what_phase-encode_vectors_to_put_into_my_--datain_text_file.3F) and
[here](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/kb-articles/kb-0003) how to calculate it). For
example

```JSON
{
   "PhaseEncodingDirection": "j-",
   "TotalReadoutTime": 0.095,
   "IntendedFor": "func/sub-01_task-motor_bold.nii.gz"
}
```

`dir_label` value can be set to arbitrary alphanumeric label (`[a-zA-Z0-9]+` for
example `LR` or `AP`) that can help users to distinguish between different
files, but should not be used to infer any scanning parameters (such as phase
encoding directions) of the corresponding sequence. Please rely only on the JSON
file to obtain scanning parameters. \_epi files can be a 3D or 4D - in the
latter case all timepoints share the same scanning parameters. To indicate which
run is intended to be used with which functional or diffusion scan the
IntendedFor field in the JSON file should be used.
